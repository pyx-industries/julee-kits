"""
Shared helpers for resolving JSON Schema $ref values.

A bare $ref schema is a dict of exactly {"$ref": "url#/fragment"}.
Resolution means fetching the URL and, if a fragment is present,
navigating to the target sub-schema and bundling the parent $defs so
that internal $ref values within the sub-schema remain valid.
