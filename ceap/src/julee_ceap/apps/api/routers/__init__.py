"""
API routers for the julee CEAP system.

This package contains APIRouter modules that organize endpoints by domain.
Each router module defines routes at the root level and is mounted with a
prefix in the main app.

Organization:
- knowledge_service_queries: CRUD operations for knowledge service queries
- assembly_specifications: CRUD operations for assembly specifications
- documents: CRUD operations for documents
- workflows: Workflow management and execution endpoints
- system: Health checks and system status endpoints

Router modules follow the pattern:
1. Define routes at root level ("/" and "/{id}")
2. Include proper dependency injection
3. Use domain models for request/response
4. Follow consistent error handling patterns
