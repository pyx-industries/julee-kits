"""
KnowledgeService protocol for external service operations in the Capture,
Extract, Assemble, Publish workflow.

This module defines the KnowledgeService protocol that handles interactions
with external knowledge services, including document registration and query
execution. This protocol is separate from the repository layer which only
handles local metadata persistence.

Concrete implementations of this protocol are provided for different external
services (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) and are created via factory functions.
