"""
Temporal activities for the polling contrib module.

This module contains the temporal activity implementations for polling operations.
These activities are registered with Temporal and can be called from workflows
to perform durable polling operations.

By keeping these activities within the contrib module, we maintain proper
dependency direction - contrib modules define their own temporal integration
without requiring the core framework to know about specific contrib modules.
